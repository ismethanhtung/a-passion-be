The verb \"have been\" is in the present perfect tense, indicating that the action started in the past and has a connection to the present.\n\nIn this case, the action is completed, so the correct verb form is the past participle \"recovered\" (not \"recover\", \"recovers\", or \"recovering\"). \"Recovered\" is the correct choice because it describes the result of the action, that the files have been successfully retrieved.\n\nFor example:\n\n* The missing accounting files have been recovered. (completed action)\n* The missing accounting files recover. (ongoing action)\n* The missing accounting files are recovering. (ongoing action)\n\nIn summary, \"recovered\" is the correct choice because it describes the completed action of recovering the missing files.",

      "content": "### Answer: D. increase\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is D. increase.\n\nThe sentence describes a situation where Aurora Furnishings is having trouble making a profit due to the difficulty of their market. The word \"competitive\" is an adjective modifying the noun \"market\", indicating that the market is highly competitive.\n\nThe verb \"finding it difficult\" is in the present tense, indicating an ongoing situation. To describe this situation, we need a verb form that agrees with the present tense. The correct verb form is the present participle \"increasing\", which describes the market as becoming more competitive.\n\nFor example:\n\n* Aurora Furnishings is finding it difficult to make a profit in its increasingly competitive market. (correct)\n* Aurora Furnishings is finding it difficult to make a profit in its competitive market increase. (incorrect - \"increase\" cannot be used as a noun in this context)\n* Aurora Furnishings is finding it difficult to make a profit in its competitive market increases. (incorrect - \"increases\" is in the wrong form)\n* Aurora Furnishings is finding it difficult to make a profit in its competitive market increased. (incorrect - \"increased\" is in the wrong tense)\n\nIn summary, \"increase\" is the correct choice because it is the correct verb form in the present tense, describing the ongoing situation of the market becoming more competitive.",
